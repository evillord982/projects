# Sonny's Personal Coding Projects

**Personal coding projects to help me learn and improve**

## 🌟 Goals

- ✅ Get better at coding
- 🎉 Have fun while building

## 📁 About

This repo is a collection of small (or not-so-small) projects that I’m using to sharpen my programming skills. It’s all about experimenting, learning by doing, and enjoying the process.


## 🛠 Tech Stack

Depending on the project, I might use:
- Python / Java / C / JavaScript / etc.
- Git for version control
- Whatever tools I’m trying to learn!

## 🚧 In Progress

This is a work in progress — things may be messy, and that’s part of the learning.

## 📌 Notes to Self

- Don’t be afraid to start small
- Commit often
- Comment your code (future me will thank you)
- Celebrate small wins!
